<h1>Privacy Policy for Timoney</h1>

<p>Timoney is provided as a free mobile application for iOS users. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information and what data, if any, is collected during usage.</p>

<p>Timoney does not display advertisements and does not use advertising-related tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>The Timoney app does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. No account creation, login, or personal data input is required to use the app.</p>

<p>Certain non-personal, diagnostic data may be collected automatically by Apple or through Apple's built-in services (e.g., App Store, iOS system analytics) solely for improving app stability and performance. This data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.</p>

<h2>Crash Logs and Analytics</h2>
<p>If you opt in to share diagnostic data with developers via iOS settings, Apple may provide anonymous crash reports (Crashlogs) to help improve the app. These logs may include device type, operating system version, and technical details about the crash, but they do not include personal information.</p>

<p>Sharing diagnostic data is entirely optional and controlled by your device settings.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>The Timoney app does not use cookies or any cookie-based tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>Timoney may require limited device permissions strictly for its core functionality (for example, internet access to retrieve financial data or sync settings). Permissions are never used to collect personal information.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Timoney does not collect personal data from children under the age of 13, nor from any users. The app is designed to work without requiring personal information at any stage.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Timoney does not integrate any third-party SDKs for advertising, analytics, or user tracking. No external service has access to user data through the app.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Since Timoney does not collect or store any personal information, there is no risk of exposure of such data. However, the app still adheres to industry-standard security principles to ensure safe and reliable usage.</p>

<h2>Financial Information</h2>
<p>Timoney does not process payments within the app. If in the future you choose to support the developer or make an in-app purchase, all payments are handled exclusively by Apple’s App Store. No financial information (e.g., credit card, billing details) is ever accessed or stored by Timoney.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>The app may include optional external links (e.g., support pages). These websites are not operated by me. You are advised to review the Privacy Policies of any external services you visit.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Since the app does not collect personal information, requests for data access, deletion, or modification are not applicable. However, you may control any diagnostic data sharing directly from your iOS device settings.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will become effective as soon as they are available.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact me.</p>
